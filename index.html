  <p>Over the past few years, the Twombly family has worked on renovating Cy Twombly’s old studio in Bassano in Teverina. The 17th century palazzo was acquired in 1975 and with the cooperation of Giorgio Franchetti it was remodeled into a home and studio. It was officially inaugurated as Fondazione Iris on July 5, 2023.
    <br><br>
    For Cy, Bassano signified an escape into an atavistic land that is the Tuscia in central Italy, home of the ancient Etruscans. As the heat in the city intensified during humid Italian summers, the thick tuff (the endemic stone of the area) helped keep these rooms temperate. Cy lived and worked here in ascetic conditions and opened the doors only for family and close collaborators, intimately painting some of his career’s most significant works.
    <br><br>
    <em>Fondazione Iris</em> stands as a physical testimony of the Twombly family spirit and its ambition to cultivate the ideas and daimon of artists. Iris welcomes artists and functions as an exhibition and performance space as well as a center of studies for scholars wishing to research Cy’s library. Within this space, our aim is to not only support but also inspire the practices of these artists, fostering a genuine environment for investigation and exploration.
    <br><br>
    In commemoration of its inauguration in 2023, Iris proudly presented an exhibition by Robert Nava, in collaboration with Amanita and Pace Gallery, showcasing a body of work created during his residency at the palace.
    <br><br>
    Fondazione Iris will be opening its doors to the public again in June 2024, showcasing a body of work by Hungarian-born American artist, Rita Ackermann.
